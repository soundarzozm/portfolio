					I'm currently an Engineer at Upstatement building things for
					the web with some awesome people. I recently graduated from
					Northeastern University after completing three awesome
					six-month co-ops at MullenLowe U.S., Starry, and Apple
					Music.

					As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between
					engineering and design â€” combining my technical knowledge
					with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product.
					My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
					and efficient under the hood while providing engaging,
					pixel-perfect user experiences.

					When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably
					snowboarding, cruising around on my penny board, or crossing
					off another item on my bucket list.
