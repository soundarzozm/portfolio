					I&apos;m currently a <strong>Front End Engineer</strong> at{' '}

					As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between
					engineering and design â€” combining my technical knowledge
					with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product.
					My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
					and efficient under the hood while providing engaging,
					pixel-perfect user experiences.

					probably <strong>sleeping</strong>, banging my head to{' '}
					<strong>hip-hop</strong>, or <strong>working out</strong>.
