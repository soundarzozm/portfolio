					I'm currently a <strong>Front End Engineer</strong> at{' '}
					<strong>NCR Corporation</strong> building a chatbot with
					some awesome people. I recently graduated from Manipal
					University.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between
					engineering and design â€” combining my technical knowledge
					with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product.
					My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
					and efficient under the hood while providing engaging,
					pixel-perfect user experiences.

					When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably
					sleeping, banging my head to hip-hop, or crossing off
					another item on my bucket list.
